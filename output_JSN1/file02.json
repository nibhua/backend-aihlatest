Publications of the \nupdated document will be available on the ISTQB website. \nThe ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for \nsome time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often \nare brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the \nExpert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the \nISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and \nintroduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but \nthat is beyond the scope of this document. \nThe following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released: \nAgile Tester \nIn this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business \nOutcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who \nachieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and \nwill outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this \nlevel."
